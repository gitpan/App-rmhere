NAME
    App::rmhere - Delete files in current directory

VERSION
    version 0.03

RELEASE DATE
    2014-04-25

SYNOPSIS
    See rmhere script.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  rmhere(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Delete files in current directory.

    This function supports dry-run operation.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   estimate => *bool*

        Count files first before start deleting.

        With this opotion, the program will do an "opendir" and list the
        directory first. This can take several minutes if the directory is
        large, so the program will not start deleting after several minutes.
        But with this option, we know how many files we want to delete, so
        the progress report will know when to reach 100%.

    *   here => *str*

        Override current directory.

    *   interactive => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to ask first before deleting each file.

    *   progress => *bool*

        Show progress report.

    Special arguments:

    *   -dry_run => *bool*

        Pass -dry_run=>1 to enable simulation mode.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.
